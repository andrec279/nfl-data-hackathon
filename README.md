# nfl-data-hackathon
This repo contains jupyter notebooks and code I submitted to a hackathon I participated in for an undisclosed NFL team. 

<b>Hackathon Goal:</b> Use NFL's next-gen player tracking data (in-game player xyz coordinates at 0.1s refresh rate) to develop useful insights for undisclosed NFL team in coaching or player scouting.

<b>Personal Motivation:</b> I participated in this hackathon to get hands-on experience working with massive, highly complex data in the AWS Cloud environment, as well as sharpen my business and analytical skills in developing a valuable use case for the data.

<b>Technical Environment:</b> Python (PySpark, Pandas, NumPy, MatPlotLib), AWS S3, Sagemaker, Athena

<b>Use Case:</b> Develop a holistic measure of offensive linemen performance based on how often they allowed their mark to beat them and pressure the QB.

<b>Challenges:</b>
- Highly denormalized and complex data
- Total lack of football knowledge
- Time needed to familiarize with AWS Environment

Solution is described in detail in Jupyter Notebooks.
